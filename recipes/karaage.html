    <p>I’ve spent years sampling the best of kaarage , and finally cracked the code to make the ultimate version at home. It’s a meal my entire family begs for—including my five year old who dunks each piece in Kewpie Mayo until it’s covered! A great way to feed your loved ones and hear no complaints. EVER.</p>
